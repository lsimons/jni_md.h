# jni_md.h
Header file from Oracle JDK6u41 on windows

This file was extracted from jdk-6u41-windows-i586.exe retrieved from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-java-archive-javase6-downloads.html for the purpose of compiling a new version of log4j 1.x following the instructions to do so at https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/building.html .

The downloaded distribution was retrieved under the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for Java SE and JavaFX Technologies, https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/java-se-archive-license.html , which I believe does not allow uploading it here. That means uploading this file could be considered a license violation, but I do not believe it is actually so in this case: this file is a minimal API-only definition file that I believe on its own should not be subject to copyright restrictions given fair use, especially with the current need around mitigating log4j security problems.

Note there is an identical file (aside from the license header) at https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/master/src/java.base/windows/native/include/jni_md.h licensed under GPLv2 + classpath exception.
